最近的日子里，频繁地在听菅野よう子的《Green Bird》
来自于上个世纪动画中的感动

今天早上收到了邮件
押金的事情得到了较为完美的解决
也不再需要什么奇技淫巧
倒是也蛮好

当然，内心中还是有一些失落感的

渐渐地
可以留在深圳的日子越来越少

"I hate this story.
Men only think about the past right before their death
as if they were searching frantically for proof that they were alive.
Turn back.
You told me when we first met that you were a man who had already died once.
Just forget the past, okay?"

"There was a woman.
For the first time in my life I saw a woman that was truly alive.
That's what I believed.
She was a piece of me I had lost.
She is my other half that I had longed for."
