title: "Bitter Sweet Symphony"
---

前些日子里，看网易云里歌单的时候看到了The Fray的Never say never
就想到了以前也有在豆瓣fm上听过很多英文的摇滚乐
脑子里浮现出了一张当时听到的专辑封面
费了九牛二虎之力，找到了那首歌

The Verve的Bitter Sweet Symphony

当然 这首歌的MV也非常的精彩

'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Try to make ends meet
You're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet yeah,

No change, I can't change
I can't change, I can't change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people
From one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no

Well I never pray
But tonight I'm on my knees yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now
